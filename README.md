# Event Management System

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to build a web application powered by Python Flask and Jinja2 templates for the frontend. This platform aims to facilitate proper event management and allow clients to request event grounds through our system.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main directories:

- **frontend**: Contains all the frontend components of the application.
- **backend**: Contains the backend logic and configuration for the application.

### Directory Structure


## Backend Architecture

### 1. **venv**
- The `venv` directory contains the virtual environment for the backend. This environment isolates the project dependencies and manages environment variables.

### 2. **routes**
- The `routes` directory contains all the route definitions for the application. Each route corresponds to a specific endpoint in the web application, handling requests and responses.

### 3. **database**
- The `database` directory holds the configuration settings for the database connection. This includes information such as the database URL, credentials, and any other necessary configurations.

### 4. **models**
- The `models` directory contains the schema definitions for the database. This includes the structure of the tables and the relationships between them, allowing for efficient data management.

## Frontend Architecture

The `frontend` directory includes all the necessary files for the user interface, such as HTML templates, CSS stylesheets, and JavaScript files. The frontend uses Jinja2 templates to dynamically render content based on data provided by the backend.

## Conclusion

This project aims to create a robust platform for event management, making it easier for clients to request and manage event grounds. By utilizing Flask for the backend and Jinja2 for the frontend, we ensure a seamless and efficient user experience.
